# Social Network Application

This is a full-stack social networking application that includes basic functionalities such as registering, logging in, posting, liking, disliking, friend requests, and more. The project is implemented using **Scala (Play Framework)** on the backend, **ReactJS** on the frontend, and **MySQL** as the database. The application allows users to interact with each other by creating posts, adding friends, and liking/disliking posts.

## Features

### Authentication
- **Register**: Users can register by creating a new account.
- **Login**: Authentication is handled using JWT tokens.
- **JWT Token Authentication**: After logging in, a JWT token is stored and used for authenticating subsequent requests.

### Main Page
- **View Posts**: Users can view posts from their friends.
- **Like/Dislike**: Users can like or dislike posts (if already liked).
- **Post Ordering**: Posts are displayed in descending order with the most recent posts at the top.

- **View Friends**: Users can see a list of their friends.

### Other Users' Pages
- **View Other Users' Profiles**: Users can visit the profiles of other users. If they are friends, they can see the posts. If not, they will be given the option to send a friend request.
- **Add Friend**: If users are not friends, an "Add Friend" button is shown.

### Friend Requests
- **Send Friend Request**: Users can send friend requests to other users.
- **Accept/Reject Friend Request**: Users can accept or reject received friend requests.
